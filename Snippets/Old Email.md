This is due to a performance enhancing changing made in Sapphire. We now only load recent emails rather than all of them. This significantly speeds the system up for everyone.

In order to access older email you can either go to https://outlook.office365.com or search for them in your Desktop Outlook, which will retrieve them from the server. For instance this:
received>1/1/2010
will retrieve all mail in that folder sent after 2010. For more please see:

Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact the IT service desk if you have any further issues, questions or concerns.
